This is Sample Project for learning Micro Frontend. In this project in the remote app, I create a Counter component and use it in this app. Then we export this component from webpack so now I can use this component in the host app. First import component from webpack then use it in the host app. In this app both host and remote are the same react js, but you can use this concept for any technology. For example, we have the host app with react js and remote angular or anything. Hope this sample helps you understand the Micro frontend. Wish best!!
